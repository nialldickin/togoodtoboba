# togoodtoboba
Joyce and I have a boba addiction, but it's quite expensive to fund so we've resorted to TooGoodToGo-ing boba whenever we can to save money.

The problem with this is that everytime we check the app all the boba places nearby have sold out in 10 minutes. Being a dev I suggested we automate this.
